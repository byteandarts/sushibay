I want to create a website that combines two distinct restaurant concepts: "Café Supreme," which focuses on coffee, breakfast, and international mains, and "Sushi Bay," which specializes in fresh sushi and Japanese cuisine. 
I have attached a website design i like and want you to follow it which can be found in index.html and screenshot of the site is screen.png 

Important: Please note that the website will be deployed on github pages. 

There is also a menu item and prices for both: cafe is in cafe.json and sushi is in sushi.json in case you needed them.

once you are done create image.md which should contains a prompt for every image used and need ot be generated. it should have name of the image coffee_latte.webp and the prmpt needed for it.  

I also added a logo image for both, put please note these are large images and not really a a polished logo images, so alter them as you see fit. i also have ffmpeg installed if you need to edit or resize any image. the cafe supreme logo is on white background so you are aware.

Page Title: Our Story
Headline: Two Worlds. One Table.
At Café Supreme & Sushi Bay, we believe you shouldn’t have to compromise when it comes to good food.
What started as a passion for the "Good Living" lifestyle has evolved into a unique dining destination where East meets West. We recognized that the best moments happen when friends and families gather, but we also know that cravings are unique. That’s why we brought two distinct culinary worlds together under one roof.
Whether you are craving the comfort of a gourmet burger and a hot latte, or the fresh snap of artisan sushi, we have a seat waiting for you.
The Café Supreme Story: "The Good Living"
Café Supreme was born out of a simple desire: to create a space that feels like a second home. We operate on the philosophy of "Good Living"—the idea that life is too short for bad coffee or average meals.
From our signature Spanish Latte to our legendary Molten Cake, every item on our menu is crafted to bring you comfort. We are more than just a coffee shop; we are a destination for hearty breakfasts, international main courses, and the perfect environment to work, relax, or catch up with old friends. When you are with us, you are family.
• Our Promise: Premium beans, home-style recipes, and an atmosphere that invites you to stay a while.
The Sushi Bay Story: "Freshness Rolled Daily"
Sushi Bay adds a different flavor to our story—one defined by precision, freshness, and creativity. We saw a need for high-quality Japanese cuisine that is both authentic and accessible.
Our chefs treat every roll as a canvas. Whether it’s the crunch of our Fried Rolls or the delicate balance of our Sashimi Platters, we prioritize ingredients that are sourced fresh and prepared with skill. We bring the vibrant energy of Asian fusion dining to your table, offering a lighter, zestier counterpart to your dining experience.
• Our Promise: Catch-of-the-day freshness, artistic presentation, and bold flavors that excite the palate.
Why We Are Better Together
Have you ever tried to plan a dinner where one person wants pizza and the other wants sushi? We solved that.
By uniting Café Supreme and Sushi Bay, we offer the ultimate dining freedom. You can enjoy a Supreme Club Sandwich while your partner enjoys a Spicy Lemon Roll, and you can both split a Molten Cake for dessert.
Diverse Tastes. Unified Quality. Unforgettable Memories.
